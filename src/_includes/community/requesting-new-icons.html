  <h2 class="page-header">Requesting New Icons</h2>
  <p>
    New icons start as requests by the
    <a href="{{ site.fontawesome.github.url }}/issues">{{ site.fontawesome.site_title }} community on GitHub</a>. Want to request a new
    icon? Here are some things to keep in mind:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Please be nice. {{ site.fontawesome.site_title }} is a happy place.</li>
    <li>Please <a href="{{ site.fontawesome.github.url }}/search?type=Issues">search</a> to see if your icon request already exists. If a request is found, please +1 that one.</li>
    <li>
      Please make requests for single icons, unless you are requesting a couple of strictly related icons (e.g., thumbs-up/thumbs-down).
    </li>
    <li>
      Please and thank you if you include the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Title your <a href="{{ site.fontawesome.github.url }}/issues/new?title=Icon%20Request:%20rh-">new issue</a>
          <code>Icon request: rh-name</code> (e.g., <code>Icon request: rh-lotus-root</code>).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
